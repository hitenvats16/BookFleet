# BookFleet

An Android application to read, share and connect the knowledge.

## Inspiration

There was a problem of the lack of public libraries in India for reading enthusiasts. So we wanted to build an online library where people can upload books & share them with other people. This will greatly help those people living in remote areas who have limited access to public libraries.

## What it does

Here, a person can upload his/her books that he has either read or want to give to other people either on a rental basis or sell out to them. A second person who is searching for a similar book can find it on the app and then can contact the former to rent out the book.

## How we built it

We first created a basic design on Figma. Coded the frontend part first using react native and then started adding the backend. Adding the backend was a tough task and then did some finishing touches.

## Challenges we ran into

-> There were some bugs in react native whose solutions weren't available on the internet. 
-> React Native API has been deprecated. Therefore, we needed to read the whole documentation which was a very tedious task.
-> The watchman in react native needed some updates that we weren't aware of. Therefore, we needed to start and restart the server several times.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

1. We got to learn app-building step by step.
2.  We learned team building & got the 
opportunity to work with amazing people with great technical skills. 
3. We got to learn about the real-world problems which needed to be addressed and
 we tried a technical approach for the same.
4. We discovered some really amazing technical solutions to real-world problems 
which inspired us to address our problem in a more realistic & efficient way.

## What we learned

Before this Hackathon, we didn't know or were even aware of the react-native expo. Throughout this creating journey, we were fortunate enough to learn about the basic understandings of an android application's inner workings. JavaScript, React-Native, Expo, and firebase. 

## What's next for Book Fleet

Till now application provides a very rough experience and users have to explicitly contact the book owners. In the future, we are planning to add a shipping system that would help users to get books at their doorsteps at very cheap or barely noticeable pricing. We are also planning to add a system that would filter out the results and show the tailored results.
